# CMU10-714: Deep Learning System

The rapid growth and widespread adoption of deep learning is largely due to a number of simple and powerful programming frameworks, such as Pytorch and Tensorflow.However, most practitioners are only "packmen" of these frameworks and have little knowledge of the internal implementation details of these frameworks.If you're interested in developing the underlying frameworks for deep learning, or are just as curious as I am about the inner implementations of these frameworks, this course is a great place to start.

The content outline of the course covers the knowledge system of the deep learning system "full stack".From the top-level design of modern deep learning system framework, to the principle and implementation of self-differentiation algorithm, to the underlying hardware acceleration and actual production deployment.In order to better grasp the theoretical knowledge, students will design and implement a complete deep learning library Needle from scratch in 5 course assignments, enabling automatic differentiation of calculation graphs, hardware acceleration on GPU, and support for various loss functions, data loaders, and optimizers.On this basis, students will implement several common neural networks, including CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformer and so on.

The course will begin step by step with simple classification problems and backpropagation optimization. The accompanying jupyter notebook will describe the implementation details for some relatively complex neural networks.If you have some basic knowledge, then you can start the course work directly after learning the content of self-differentiation. Although it is not difficult, I believe it will bring you a new understanding.
